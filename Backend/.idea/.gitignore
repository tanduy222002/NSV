If you are a leaf, I am the ground,
Together we weave, a tale profound.
A dance of nature, forever unbound.


If you are a leaf, gentle and light,
I am the ground, holding you tight.
catching your wishes, in the soft moonlight.

In The river of time, a special day's dawn,
A celebration of you, since the moment you were drawn.
A year older, a chapter new,
A journey continued, dreams to pursue.
